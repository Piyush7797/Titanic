# Titanic Survival Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning project to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic using Python and scikit-learn.

## Project Overview

The project uses the classic Titanic dataset to train a predictive model. The main tasks include:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Saving the trained model for deployment
